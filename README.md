✨ Image-Enhancer: Image Super-Resolution using Efficient Transformers (ESRT)This repository provides an optimized, modular implementation of the Efficient Super-Resolution Transformer (ESRT) model for high-quality image enhancement and super-resolution. We focus on reconstructing sharp, high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) inputs, prioritizing speed, memory efficiency, and real-world performance on consumer hardware.🚀 Overview & The ESRT AdvantageTraditional SR models often struggle with real-world complexities like non-ideal degradations and computational demands. ESRT overcomes these challenges by combining a novel architecture:✔️ Lightweight Transformers: For efficient global feature extraction.✔️ CNN-Based Residual Blocks: For robust local detail reconstruction.✔️ Hierarchical Feature Extraction: To capture details at multiple scales.✔️ Kernel-Aware Processing: To handle varied degradation kernels accurately.This project implements the full ESRT pipeline—including architecture, dataloaders, training, and inference—in a structured, modular way that makes experimentation effortless.The long-term goal is to be a clean benchmarking hub for comparing super-resolution architectures like ESRGAN, SwinIR, NAFNet, and Restormer under the same training setup.⭐ Key FeaturesIconFeatureDescription🔥Full ImplementationComplete ESRT pipeline: Training, Validation, and Inference scripts.📁Modular CodeClean, intuitive structure for easy model replacement and experimentation.📈EvaluationIntegrated support for standard PSNR/SSIM metrics.🧪Experiment TrackingCheckpoint saving and tracking via Git LFS.🛠️Utility ToolsScripts for dataset preparation, visualization, and validation.🏗️Future-ProofDesigned to easily plug in next-gen models (ESRGAN, SwinIR, NAFNet, Restormer).📚 Dataset: DF2K (DIV2K, Flickr2K, OST)We train on DF2K, a high-quality composite dataset essential for robust super-resolution:📦 DIV2K: Diverse, high-quality images.📦 Flickr2K: Large-scale collection of high-resolution photos.📦 OST (Outdoor Scenes Dataset): Focus on complex outdoor textures and scenes.Note: The dataset is stored locally in datasets/DF2K/ and is ignored via .gitignore. You must download DF2K manually before starting training.🎯 Applications of Super-ResolutionSuper-resolution is critical whenever original high-quality data is unavailable and detail restoration is essential. This project demonstrates techniques used in:📸 Photography Enhancement: Improving mobile, DSLR, and CCTV images.🩺 Medical Imaging: Upscaling X-ray and MRI scans for pre-processing.🛰️ Remote Sensing: Restoration of satellite and aerial imagery.🕵️‍♂️ Forensics: Enhancing low-quality or degraded evidence images.🎥 Video Upscaling: (Future extension for real-time video processing).📂 Project File StructureThe project is structured for clarity and scalability:Image-Enhancer/
